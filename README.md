### A project on Unsupervised Machine Learning

## Overview of the analysis
### Background and purpose of this project
A fictional client, Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. So, theyâ€™ve asked for a report that includes which cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

## Results
### Grouping Tradable Coins

- After processing the data provided, it was determined that there are 532 tradable cryptocurrencies on the market. 
- Using the elbow curve method, these cryptocurrencies were sorted into 3 clusters.
